# IMDb Movie Revenue Prediction
This project is a simple exercise in predicting movie revenue using data from the IMDb database. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
The project consists of the following steps:

- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Scaling
- Modeling using Decision Tree Regressor
- Tuning the model using GridSearchCV and Random Forest Regressor.
## Results
The final model had the following performance:

Mean Absolute Error: 34.00
Mean Squared Error: 2165.24
Root Mean Squared Error: 46.53
R-squared score: 0.67

It is important to note that this model is not very accurate and is intended for learning purposes only. The goal of this project was to practice data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, feature scaling, and modeling techniques, rather than to build an accurate revenue prediction model.
